Introduction
------------

This project is an emscripten port of glfw written in C++ for the web/wasm platform.

Goal
----

The main goal of this project is to provide as many features from glfw as possible (in a browser context).

Since this project is targeting the web/webassembly platform, which runs in more recent web browsers, it is also trying
to focus on using the most recent features and not use deprecated features (for example, uses `keyboardEvent.key` 
vs `keyboardEvent.charcode`). As a result, this implementation will most likely not work in older browsers.

Since the code is written in C++, it is trying to minimize the amount of javascript code to remain clean and lean.

A wishful goal would be to potentially replace the built-in emscripten/glfw code in the future if this effort 
is successful, or most likely, offer it as an option.

Status
------

The project is now mature enough and has reached 1.0.0 status.

Main supported features:
* can create as many windows as you want, each one associated to a different canvas (use 
  `emscripten_glfw_set_next_window_canvas_selector("#canvas2")` to specify which canvas to use)
* resizable window/canvas (use `emscripten_glfw_make_canvas_resizable(...)` to make the canvas resizable by user.
  Use `"window"` as the resize selector for full frame canvas (ex: ImGui))
* mouse (includes sticky button behavior)
* keyboard (includes sticky key behavior)
* joystick/gamepad
* fullscreen
* Hi DPI 
* all glfw cursors
* window opacity
* size constraints (size limits and aspect ratio)
* visibility
* focus
* timer

Demo
----

![emscripten_glfw](https://github.com/pongasoft/emscripten-glfw/releases/download/wip-0.5.0/emscripten_glfw.png)

Checkout the [live demo](https://pongasoft.github.io/emscripten-glfw/demo/main.html) of the example code. Note that you
need to use a "modern" browser to see it in action. Currently tested on Google Chrome 120+ and Firefox 121+. 

The [code](test/client/src) for the demo is included in this project.

The demo shows 2 canvases each created via a `glfwCreateWindow` and shows how they respond to keyboard and mouse events
(using direct apis, like `glfwGetMouseButton` or callback apis like `glfwSetMouseButtonCallback`)

- canvas1 is hi dpi aware (`glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR, GLFW_TRUE)`)
- canvas2 is **not** hi dpi aware (but can be made so with the "Enable" Hi DPI Aware button)
- canvas2 is fully resizable (use the square handle to resize) (`emscripten_glfw_make_canvas_resizable(window2, "#canvas2-container", "#canvas2-handle")`)

You can enable/disable each window/canvas independently:

- When 2 (or more) canvases are present, the canvas that has focus can receive keyboard events. If no other element on 
  the page has focus, then the last canvas that had the focus will receive these events. Clicking with the left mouse 
  button on a canvas gives it focus.
- When there is only 1 canvas, the implementation try to be smart about it and will route keyboard (and other relevant) 
  events to the single canvas provided that nothing else has focus (the 'Change focus/Text' field is used to test 
  this feature since clicking in the text field grabs the focus).

The demo uses webgl to render a triangle (the hellow world of gpu rendering...).

Usage
-----

Check the [Usage](docs/Usage.md) documentation for details on how to use this implementation. Note that care has been
taken to backward compatible with the pure javascript implementation built-in in emscripten.

Building
--------

### CMake

If you use CMake, you should be able to simply add this project as a subdirectory. Check 
[CMakeLists.txt](test/client/CMakeLists.txt) for an example of the build options used. 

### Makefile

I am successfully building ImGui (`examples/example_emscripten_wgpu`) against this implementation with the following section in the `Makefile`:

```Makefile
# local glf3 port
EMS_GLFW3_DIR = /Volumes/Development/github/org.pongasoft/emscripten-glfw
SOURCES += $(EMS_GLFW3_DIR)/src/cpp/glfw3.cpp

Release Notes
-------------

#### wip-0.6.0 - TBD

- Removed `GLFW_EMSCRIPTEN_CANVAS_SELECTOR` window hint in favor of a new api `emscripten_glfw_set_next_window_canvas_selector`
- Removed `GLFW_EMSCRIPTEN_CANVAS_RESIZE_SELECTOR` and `Module.glfwSetCanvasResizableSelector` in favor of a new 
  api `emscripten_glfw_make_canvas_resizable`
- This new api also offer the ability to deal with the handle automatically
- Implemented `getWindowPosition` (canvas position in the browser window)
- Implemented all timer apis (`glfwSetTime`, `glfwGetTimerValue` and `glfwGetTimerFrequency`)
- Implemented `glfwExtensionSupported`
- Implemented `glfwSetWindowTitle` (changes the browser window title)

#### wip-0.5.0 - 2023/01/12

- Added support for resizable canvas (`glfwWindowHintString(GLFW_EMSCRIPTEN_CANVAS_RESIZE_SELECTOR, "#canvas2-container")` 
  from c/c++ code or `Module.glfwSetCanvasResizableSelector('#canvas2', '#canvas2-container')` from javascript) 
- Added support fo visibility (`glfwShowWindow` and `glfwHideWindow`)
- Added support for `GLFW_FOCUS_ON_SHOW` window hint/attribute
- Added support for dynamic Hi DPI Awareness (`GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR` can be used in `glfwSetWindowAttrib`)
- Added support for "sticky" mouse button and keyboard
- Added support for window size constraints (`glfwSetWindowSizeLimits` and `glfwSetWindowAspectRatio`)
- Added support for providing a callback function in javascript to be notified when a window is created (`Module.glfwOnWindowCreated`)

#### wip-0.4.0 - 2023/01/03

- Added support for joystick/gamepad
  - Joystick support can be disabled via `EMSCRIPTEN_GLFW3_DISABLE_JOYSTICK` compilation flag

- Added support for input mode `GLFW_CURSOR` (handle all use cases: Normal / Hidden / Locked)
- Added support for glfw defined cursors (implemented `glfwCreateStandardCursor` and `glfwSetCursor`)
- Added support for window opacity (implemented `glfwGetWindowOpacity` and `glfwSetWindowOpacity`)

#### wip-0.2.0 - 2023/12/28

- remembers the last window that had focus so that some events can be sent to it even if no window has 
  focus (ex: requesting fullscreen)
- added support for mouse wheel (`glfwSetScrollCallback`)
- added support for mouse enter/leave (`glfwSetCursorEnterCallback`)

#### wip-0.1.0 - 2023/12/26

- first public version
